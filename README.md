# Stopwatch React Application

This is a simple stopwatch application built using React. It allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer, displaying hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

## Features

- Start: Begins the stopwatch timer.
- Stop: Pauses the stopwatch timer.
- Reset: Resets the stopwatch timer to zero.

## Code Structure
The main logic of the stopwatch is implemented in the App.js file. Here's a brief overview of the file:

- App component: Main component responsible for rendering the stopwatch and buttons.
- State variables (hour, min, second, miliSecond, stop): Manage the state of the stopwatch and timer.
- Event handlers (onStart, onStop, onReset): Functions to handle start, stop, and reset actions.
- useEffect hook: Manages the timer logic using intervals.
- JSX: Renders the stopwatch display and buttons.
